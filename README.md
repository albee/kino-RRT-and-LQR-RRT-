This repo includes code for three different approaches to trajectory optimization for an underactuated satellite. The approaches are:

* GPOPS-II direct collocation
* Direct transcription via Drake
* LQR-RRT* (and other sampling-based planning methods)

Please see the included final report for documentation.

Here are some of the Guided-Kino-RRT results:
